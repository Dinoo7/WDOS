      <h1>Luxury Products Made with Tea</h1>
      <p>
        Tea Infusions have been sipped for centuries. This has not only been
        done for enjoyment, but also specifically used as healing teas. The
        ingredients extracted from various parts of the bark, stem, root, leaf
        or bud seem to have a remedy for just about any ailment. Apart from
        healthy tonics, tea is also being used to create products all around the
        house. Some of these items have even been marketed as luxury products
        which has enhanced the brand equity of tea.

          <h3>Potpurri/Aromatic Tea Satchet</h3>
          <p>
            A collection of naturally flavored dried herbs and flowers is called

          <h3>Tea as a Household Cleaner</h3>
          <p>
            While tea is not specifically marketed as a luxury good when used as
            a household cleaning, it can add shine to your pricey furnishings.
            It works wonders to sprinkle dry green tea on your carpets and rugs
            for 10 minutes before vacuuming them up. Wooden floors can benefit
            from being polished with brewed tea. Additionally, you may add a
            beautiful shimmer to a mirror or window by just rubbing a used
            teabag against them.
