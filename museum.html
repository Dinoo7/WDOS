          The Ceylon Tea Museum is located in the former Hanthana Tea Factory,
          which was originally constructed in 1925. It is situated 3 km (1.9 mi)
          south of Kandy. Hanthana was one of the first successful areas to
          cultivate tea following the failure of coffee production on the
          island. In 1959 the Tea Research Institute of Ceylon established a sub
          station on land leased from the Hanthana Estate, similar to the
          Passara sub station established in the 1920s. The Hanthana Station was
          set up to cater to the needs of mid-country tea plantations with
          regard to the physiology, entomology of tea and in particular the
          identification of drought resistant clones and the insect pest
          shot-hole borer.

          The Ceylon Tea Museum was incorporated on 9 January 1998, under
          Section 21 of the Companies Act of 1982, in a move initiated by
          Clifford Ratwatte (Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board). The museum
          was formally opened on 1 December 2001. The four storey tea factory
          had been abandoned for more than a decade before it was refurbished in
          2001 by the Sri Lanka Tea Board and the Plantersâ€™ Association of Sri
          Lanka.
