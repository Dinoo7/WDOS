      <h1>Ceylon Tea Industry</h1>
      <p>
        From 1867 to today, Sri Lankan Tea Industry still survives and thrives…!
        <br />

        By the hands of a Scottish planter, James Taylor, 19 acres of tea were
        planted in Kandy, Sri Lanka, marking a cornerstone for a later
        industrial boom in agriculture. Tea was not just a drink to quench
        thirst and fatigue but a means to show the status of a household.
        Countries like Japan, China and Britain have even formed cultures around
        tea ceremonies. However, most of the tea produced in Sri Lanka is
        exported to the middle east and western countries where the majority is
        well off with a good appreciation for exotic flavours. Currently, tea in
        Sri Lanka has become the top agricultural export, facilitating jobs for
        around 1 million and thus the 203,000 hectares of tea lands make up 4%
        of the entirety of land in Sri Lanka generating over 340 million
        kilograms of tea every year.

      <h1>Ceylon Tea Production</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Sri Lanka is an island made for tea. The country produces tea
          throughout the year and the total tea production is about 340 million
          kilograms per annum. Sri Lanka’s tea-growing areas are mainly
          concentrated in the central highlands and southern inland areas of the
          island. <br />
          Tea grown in these areas are broadly grouped according to their
          elevations, with high grown tea sourced from tea plantations found
          from 1200 m upwards; medium grown tea from estates scattered between
          600 m to 1200 m and low grown tea from sea level up to 600 m. <br />
          In addition, Sri Lanka’s tea-growing areas are also divided into seven
          main regions based mainly on the terroir, namely Nuwara Eliya, Uda
          Pussellawa, Uva, Dimbula, Kandy, Sabaragamuwa, and Ruhuna. Each area
          produces a uniquely flavoured Ceylon Tea, mainly due to the
          contrasting elevation, climate, and terrain in each region.

      <h1>The Tea Research Institute</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The Tea Research Institute (TRI), since its inception in 1925, has
          been the only national body in Sri Lanka for generating and
          disseminating new technologies related to tea cultivation and
          processing. The TRI has always been the driving force behind the
          numerous successes achieved towards development of the Sri Lankan tea
          industry over the years. The highly competent staff of the Institute
          are capable of dealing with ever-changing problems of the industry as
          they arise. <br />
          The TRI was founded in 1925 under the Tea Research Ordinance enacted
          by Parliament in order to facilitate research into all matters
          pertaining to tea and thereby enriching the industry through a
          professional approach to commercial tea cultivation and processing.
          Mr. R G Coombe is considered as the pioneer to put forward this
          concept through the Planters’ Association of Ceylon. <br />

      <h1>Ceylon Tea Auction</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The Colombo Tea Auction is the world's biggest tea auction. Except for
          the New Year Holiday and Christmas, auctions are held every Tuesday
          and Wednesday. Each week, over 6.5 million kg are sold. <br />
          The Somerville & Co. office in Colombo hosted the country's inaugural
          tea auction on July 30, 1883. Only one lot of Kabaragala un-assorted
          tea was sold, making the auction's overall performance only moderate.
          <br />
          The 137-year-old Colombo Tea Auction was converted by COVID-19 from
          its famed outcry technique to a computerized auction system. The
          manual auction for the Sale No. 12 of 2020, which was originally set
          for 24/25 March 2020, eventually began on 4 April 2020 as an
          electronic auction. Since consumers needed to be trained before
          utilizing the system, the first auction took five days to complete.
          Today's e-Auction is held two days a week after users have had
          multiple training sessions.
